Sentiment Analysis refers to a natural language processing technique used to determine whether the feelings expressed in a piece of text, are positive, negative or neutral. Its uses include the monitoring of customer feedback in order to improve customer relationships, as well as to inform decisions as it relates to products, brands or services being offered by a company. The purpose of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on a sample of Amazon customer reviews. 

First, we will design and implement twelve different sentiment classification models. 

These models will then be evaluated on unseen data, using a number of different evaluation metrics.

After training and evaluating all the models, we will compare the metrics for each model, then decide which would be best models to explore further for this type of classification task.

The aim is to build a model capable of distinguishing between, positive, negative and neutral reviews, with a high degree of accuracy, even in cases where one or more of the review classes rarely occur.

We are constrained to use the F1 score as the primary metric for choosing the best model. Insights, however, will be drawn using other metrics where their use is deemed to be more informative than just F1 score.

Finally, we will attempt to perform topic modeling on the dataset in an effort to segment the various issues being discussed throught the reviews.
